          Hi! I'm a student at the University of Waterloo studying Systems
          Design Engineering, passionate about learning cool things.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been developing games for over 5 years, worked with simulations
          and embed software at Sunnybrook's Focused Ultrasound Lab and love
          designing websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently I'm an incoming programming intern for Compulsion Games and
          will be developing features for AAA games.
